# routing for the pipeline service will be done here, 
# aka whenever there's a call to the backend, this is where it will be received

# we'll have whatever endpoints we made available in the API here
# the endpoints here will call whichever service needed to get the required info
# then call helper functions to manipulate the data as needed
